< In many instances, there are multiple options for selecting an optimal solution $x$ (line 3).
< Two different sequences of solutions generated during the course of Alg.~\ref{alg:match} may result in different broadcast times.
< Let us take a hypercube $C_j$ as an example which has $\tau(C_j,S)=j$ for $\sigma=1$ regardless of selection of the source node.
< Alg.~\ref{alg:match} with $k=1$ always finds $\tau(C_j,S)$ for $j=1\dots 3$. 
< It also finds the optimum for $j\geq 4$ 
< provided that the subgraph induced by the current $S$ at the beginning of each iteration $t'$ forms a hypercube $C_{t'}$.
< If this tie-breaking rule is violated, the algorithm may fail to find the optimum as demonstrated in $C_4$ (TODO: image or description in the text?)
< 
< Intuitively, the broadcast time found by Alg.~\ref{alg:match} is likely to be closer to the optimum for larger $k$.
< This intuition is also confirmed by a vast majority of instances in the experimental section.
< Nevertheless, there are instances for which Alg.~\ref{alg:match} with smaller $k$ finds a better solution.
< One such example is a tree $T$ on 17 nodes with one source $s$ and $\text{deg}(s)=2$.
< The first neighbor $n_1$ of $s$ is a root of a binomial tree $B_2$ of degree two. 
< One of the leafs of $B_2$ is an endpoint of a path of length 3.
< The second neighbor $n_2$ of $s$ is adjacent to a root of binomial tree $B_3$.
< Alg.~\ref{alg:match} with $k=3$ decides that $n_1\in V_1$, $n_2\in V_2$ and eventually finds $\tau{T,\left\{s\right\}}$.
< With $k=5$, $n_1\in V_2$, $n_2\in V_1$, which results in a suboptimal solution.
< (TODO: is such an example useful? Should there be an illustration?)
